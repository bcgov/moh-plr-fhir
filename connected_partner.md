This specification is currently published as a Draft Standard on the ministry github and is not intended for implementation.  Feedback is welcome but readers should understand that there is more work to be done in testing the profiles and operations defined in this guide.  For more information, please see the <a href="future.html">Future Plans</a> page in this guide.  The integration process is described in general below.

### Getting Started
Vendors that are developing interfaces that correspond to those documented in this Implementation Guide need to meet all the requirements defined within the British Columbia Professional and Software Conformance Stadards.

To get started:

1. Download the [full package of conformance standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/software/conformance-standards).
2. Review the full set of conformance standards to ensure you can fulfill the requirements.
3. Fill out the [Vendor Application for Conformance and Integration Services](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/DownloadAsset?assetId=B2B78EF183D6419BB9E40F0423EB281B&filename=4637save.pdf) form to initiate assistance from the ministry.
4. Follow the integration processes outlined in Volume 1 of the conformance standards.  For more information about connectivity, go to the [access to environments page](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/software/getting-started/access-to-environments).

### Integration Process
The integration process and requirements are described in [Volume 1](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/software/conformance-standards) of the conformance standards.

Organizations must understand the commitment required to integrate with ministry HIE systems, including:

* Conformance standards requirements (e.g., privacy and security, training development and delivery, transport protocols)
* Message specifications for each system being accessed
* [Vendor and user agreement](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/practitioner-pro/software-development-guidelines/vendor-participation-agreement.pdf) obligations
* Connectivity requirements (network, configuration), process and costs
* Time frame to integrate
* Acceptable use policy for non-production environments
* Conformance testing process
* User/organization support model
* [Audit and compliance checks](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/software/getting-started/audit-and-compliance-checks)

The following diagram illustrates the process to develop an interface and integrate with a ministry HIE system:

Note: The timeline is an estimate and will vary depending on the organization's size and experience.

### Medical Practice Applications
Applications used in medical practice settings must meet application hosting and connectivity requirements to be integrated with ministry HIE systems.

Learn more about these [medical practice application requirements](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/software/conformance-standards/medical-practice-application-requirements).
