At this time, this Implementation Guide includes requirements for PLR Providers and Facilities.  The FHIR artifacts have been created according to the current understood expectations.  It still needs to undergo review and testing.  Over the next year, the following needs to be completed before this guide will be ready for implementation:

* Review by BC Health Information Standards Working Group
* Finalize the alignment to the Canadian Core and BC Core FHIR profiles
* Testing of the guide's operations and profiles to ensure proper coverage
* Publication to BC's FHIR Portal
