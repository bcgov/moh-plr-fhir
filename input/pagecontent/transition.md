In the future clients can transition from HL7V 3 or PRS XML to FHIR. The older specifications will not be deprecated however FHIR messages have several advantages:

*	FHIR will allow the users to receive and send Facilities and Address Validation Status which the older message specifications donâ€™t support
*	FHIR is RESTful and JSON which makes new implementations simpler than HL7 V3
