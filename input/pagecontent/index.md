### PLR Application Overview
NOTE: This text is taken from the current PLR User Guide found here: link goes here
    
The Provider and Location Registry (PLR) is the authoritative registry of British Columbia healthcare Providers’ demographic and professional information which supports activities such as:

* Patient referrals
* Informal consultations between care Providers
* Maintenance of internal Provider directories within the health sector

The PLR contains information for each Provider (e.g. personal demographics, College Identifier, Ministry Practitioner Identifier (MPID), license status, expertise, business contact, and work location) which is sourced from professional colleges and regulatory bodies such as the:

* BC College of Nursing Professionals (BCCNP)
* College of Dentists of BC (CDSBC)
* College of Midwives of BC (CMBC)
* College of Pharmacists of BC
* College of Physician and Surgeons of BC (CPSBC)
* College of Psychologists of BC
* College of Optometrists of BC

Any given Point of service (POS) can only access the Provider data fields that are included in the relevant information sharing agreements with the Ministry of Health. Specific data permissions are set within the PLR.
A POS application can use the PLR as the sole source of Provider information or to complement existing retained Provider information.

### Providers

A Provider is a person / individual or an organization acting in a role. The PLR uses the terms individual Provider and organization Provider to distinguish between the two role types.
Examples:

* Persons / Individual Provider – Dr. Sara Scalpel in the role of medical doctor.
* Organization Provider – Local Drug Mart #44 in the role of a Pharmacy.

The information recorded for Providers consists of unique identifiers, names, addresses, telecommunication numbers, electronic addresses, expertise, credentials, statuses, conditions, notes, relationships, disciplinary actions, and work locations. Information for Individual Providers also includes demographic details.
