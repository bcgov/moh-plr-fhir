# Becoming a Connected Partner

Below is a summary of the onboarding process for PLR connected parners.

1. Contact the PLR administration team.
1. An environment will be setup and configured for your testing.
1. Once the connected partner systems are ready, conformance testing will be performed (quality checks and message testing)
1. Then, Dates are discussed for Production implementation and Production setup.

All the information regarding conformance standards can be found on the [Ministry HIE conformance](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/software/getting-started "BC Government Health Information Exchange") website.

The following diagram illustrates the process to develop an interface and integrate with a ministry HIE system:

Note: The timeline is an estimate and will vary depending on the organization's size and experience.

### Getting Started
Vendors that are developing interfaces that correspond to those documented in this Implementation Guide need to meet all the requirements defined within the British Columbia Professional and Software Conformance Stadards.

To get started:

1. Download the [full package of conformance standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/software/conformance-standards).
2. Review the full set of conformance standards to ensure you can fulfill the requirements.
3. Fill out the [Vendor Application for Conformance and Integration Services](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/DownloadAsset?assetId=B2B78EF183D6419BB9E40F0423EB281B&filename=4637save.pdf) form to initiate assistance from the ministry.
4. Follow the integration processes outlined in Volume 1 of the conformance standards.  For more information about connectivity, go to the [access to environments page](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/software/getting-started/access-to-environments).

### Integration Process
The integration process and requirements are described in [Volume 1](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/software/conformance-standards) of the conformance standards.

Organizations must understand the commitment required to integrate with ministry HIE systems, including:

* Conformance standards requirements (e.g., privacy and security, training development and delivery, transport protocols)
* Message specifications for each system being accessed
* [Vendor and user agreement](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/practitioner-pro/software-development-guidelines/vendor-participation-agreement.pdf) obligations
* Connectivity requirements (network, configuration), process and costs
* Time frame to integrate
* Acceptable use policy for non-production environments
* Conformance testing process
* User/organization support model
* [Audit and compliance checks](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/software/getting-started/audit-and-compliance-checks)

### Medical Practice Applications
Applications used in medical practice settings must meet application hosting and connectivity requirements to be integrated with ministry HIE systems.

Learn more about these [medical practice application requirements](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/software/conformance-standards/medical-practice-application-requirements).
