      <td><strong>Category</strong></td>
      <td>A “super-role”, a category of related Provider Role Types. For example, the category “Nurse” might contain many Provider Role Types such as “LPN”, RN” and so on; the category “Doctors” might contain all Provider role types assigned to doctors, and so on.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Common Party Number (CPN)</strong></td>
      <td>A registry identifier generated by the PLR for each party that is a Provider. It links Provider records in multiple roles using pre-defined matching criteria.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Communication Mechanism</strong></td>
      <td>Communication mechanisms in PLR are the addresses, electronic addresses and telecommunication numbers that a Provider or registry user can be contacted at. These data objects can be used by work locations and can be associated with communication preferences.</td>

      <td><strong>Communication Preference</strong></td>
      <td>A record of how (mail, courier, etc.) and where (address, work location, etc.) health care information of a particular type (x-rays, lab reports etc.) should be sent. In addition, the Communication Preference can be designated for a particular work location, allowing the identification of a communication route for a particular work location to be routed to another location.</td>

      <td>The ability of a data source to maintain (add, update, correct or cease) specified data objects for existing PLR providers. Data authority can be <strong>Exclusive</strong> , <strong>Inclusive</strong> , or <strong>Collaborative</strong> :<br />- <em>Exclusive Authority</em> allows only one source to be able to provide specified data objects (name, address, etc.) and restricts data access to the source creator of the Provider record. <br />- <em>Inclusive Authority</em> allows multiple sources to be able to provide a specified data objects for a Provider and for PLR to be able to distinguish which source provided the data. This model supports the concept of employed Providers where any organization can hold its own independent view of a provider’s data.<br />- <em>Collaborative Authority</em> allows sources to maintain one version of specified data objects for a provider, and track which source provided each edit. This model supports multiple organizations maintaining a single set of data for a provider (e.g. multiple health authorities may maintain the work location for physicians).</td>

      <td><strong>Data Element</strong></td>
      <td>The smallest unit of data stored for a record. Also known as a data field (e.g. First Given Name).Data elements are individual data items that define a PLR data object.

      <td><strong>Data Object</strong></td>
      <td>A PLR data object is a collection of related data elements. Examples of PLR data objects are: Address, Work Location and Status.Do not confuse PLR data objects and data elements with XML elements. XML elements are used in messages to construct both PLR data objects and associated PLR data elements.</td>

      <td><strong>Data Permission Set (DPS)</strong></td>
      <td>A named collection of allowed data permissions for Provider data objects and elements. When assigned to a registry user, allows access to particular data elements. Data permissions also control the level of interaction the user may have with those data elements. The permission’s presence in a data permission set (DPS) for a data element confers that permission and its absence denies the permission.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Data Set</strong></td>
      <td>A group of Provider data elements labelled with a common name. Every Provider data element is labelled with a data set name when a source creates it in PLR. Permissions can be applied to a data set, making a particular view of Provider data available.For example, it is possible for a registry user to see just the Provider data submitted by a particular health authority.Only Provider data objects can be part of a data set and each instance of a data object can belong to only one data set. If a data set is not provided, the system will assign a data set via data permissions via the default data set for that registry user.See also Default Data Set.</td>

Depending upon implementation in a particular jurisdiction, an employed Provider may or may not also be subject to a licensing body (e.g. Physicians must be licensed by the College of Physicians and Surgeons (the licensing body)). Lab technicians and orderlies are not subject to a licensing body but, because they are employed in a health care related field, are considered employed providers.For HL7, an Employed Provider may also be known as an “Assigned Entity”.</td>

      <td>A physical geographical area represented by a point or boundaries.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Primary Source</strong></td>
      <td>A registry user with the ability to create new Provider records or to maintain data for existing providers. Primary sources determine the data access permissions for Provider records that they create (e.g. The College of Physicians and Surgeons is the primary source of Provider records for Medical Doctors).See also Creator.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Provider</strong></td>
      <td>A Provider is a person or organization acting in a role, for example Dr. Sara Harding, medical doctor (MD).The PLR distinguishes between a person or an organization acting as a Provider. The PLR uses the terms individual Provider and organization Provider to distinguish the two. Although much of the data and business rules are similar. You may see some documentation referring to “practitioners” as individual providers, and “providers” referring to organizations. This usage is historical, in use prior to the definitions given above and will not be used going forward.The introduction of unlicensed Provider types meant that the “qualifications” for inclusion in Provider Registry were no longer restricted to formally certified and licensed individuals such as doctors and pharmacists. While these Provider types are still central to the registry, PLR now also includes a class of Provider known as “Employed Providers”; that is, Providers who may not be licensed by a regulatory body but who are employees of major health care organizations.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Provider Identifier</strong></td>
      <td>A character or string of characters assigned to a Provider by a primary data source that is used to identify their Providers in the PLR.Typically this will be the identifier used by the data source to identify the Provider in their own local system (e.g. license number for College of Physicians and Surgeons).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Provider / Provider Relationship</strong></td>
      <td>A Provider relationship is an association between one Provider and another, e.g. reports to / gives direction to, registered with / a member of, partner with / partner with, professional incorporation / professional.A Provider can have multiple relationship records.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Provider and Location Registry System (PLR)</strong></td>
      <td>The Provider Registry is a standards based repository of core Provider data that is supplied by regulatory or recognized health care organizations and made available to authorized consumers to facilitate the authorized exchange of health information.The Provider Registry System includes all software components necessary to collect, maintain and distribute Provider data including electronic data interchange and web based technology.</td>
